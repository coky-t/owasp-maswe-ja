## 概要

This weakness occurs when an app fails to declare the domains it uses for tracking, declares them incompletely, or declares them inconsistently with its actual network behavior.

Platforms increasingly require apps to declare their tracking domains so the system can enforce the user's tracking choices. For example, Apple's privacy manifest lists tracking domains (`NSPrivacyTrackingDomains`), and connections to those domains are blocked when the user has not granted App Tracking Transparency permission. Inadequate or inaccurate declarations prevent the platform from enforcing the user's tracking preferences, mislead users about how their data is used, and can lead to app-review rejections.

## 流入の形態

- **Missing or Incomplete Declarations**: Not declaring tracking domains at all, or declaring only a subset of the domains the app actually contacts for tracking purposes.

## 影響

- **Violation of User Privacy**: Tracking traffic can bypass the platform's enforcement of the user's tracking choice, resulting in users being tracked despite having refused permission.
- **Loss of User Trust**: Users and researchers can discover undeclared tracking connections, resulting in negative publicity and reduced trust in the app.
- **Legal and Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Inaccurate tracking declarations can violate platform policies and privacy regulations, resulting in app-review rejection, removal, or fines for the app owner.

## 緩和策

- **Declare All Tracking Domains**: Enumerate every domain used for tracking, including those contacted by third-party SDKs, in the platform's declaration mechanism (e.g. the privacy manifest's `NSPrivacyTrackingDomains`).
