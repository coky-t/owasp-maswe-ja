## 概要

This weakness occurs when authentication for a sensitive transaction can silently fall back from biometrics to a weaker device credential such as a PIN, pattern, or password.

Device credentials are typically short, reusable, and observable, so allowing them as a fallback drops the assurance level below what a high-value operation requires. On Android, this happens when `DEVICE_CREDENTIAL` is permitted as an authenticator (e.g. via `BiometricPrompt.setAllowedAuthenticators`) for a sensitive action; on iOS, when `LAPolicy.deviceOwnerAuthentication` is used instead of `LAPolicy.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics`. Sensitive transactions should require biometrics and be bound to a biometric-protected key rather than permitting a non-biometric fallback.

## 流入の形態

- **Device Credential Allowed for Sensitive Actions**: Permitting `DEVICE_CREDENTIAL` as an accepted authenticator for high-value operations on Android.
- **Generic Authentication Policy on iOS**: Using `LAPolicy.deviceOwnerAuthentication`, which allows passcode fallback, instead of `LAPolicy.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics` for sensitive operations.
- **Operation Not Bound to a Biometric-Only Key**: Protecting the sensitive operation with a UI-level prompt rather than a keystore key that only unlocks with strong biometric authentication.

## 影響

- **Authentication or Authorization Bypass**: Attackers can complete authentication challenges intended to require the user's biometrics, resulting in unauthorized approval of sensitive operations.
- **Financial Loss**: Attackers can authorize payments or transfers with a stolen device and its credential, resulting in direct financial harm to the user.

## 緩和策

- **Require Biometrics for Sensitive Transactions**: Configure the authentication prompt to accept only strong biometrics (e.g. `BIOMETRIC_STRONG` on Android, `LAPolicy.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics` on iOS) for high-value operations.
- **Bind Operations to Biometric-Only Keys**: Protect the operation with a keystore key that requires strong biometric authentication for use and is invalidated on new biometric enrollments (see @MASWE-0022).
- **Match Assurance to Sensitivity**: Allow device-credential fallback only for low-risk convenience features, never for the transactions that motivated biometric protection in the first place.
