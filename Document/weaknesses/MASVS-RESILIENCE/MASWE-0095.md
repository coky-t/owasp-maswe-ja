draft:
  description: The app contains leftover debugging logic or test code (CWE-489) that was not removed before release, which can disable critical protections like TLS certificate validation. It may also include hidden settings or functions that allow bypassing security controls (CWE-912), making the app vulnerable to manipulation.
  topics:
  - backdoors
  - hidden settings to e.g. disable TLS verification
status: placeholder
