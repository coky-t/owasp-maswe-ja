draft:
  description: The app contains non-production resources that should not be present in production builds, such as non-production URLs, code flows, or verbose logging. These resources help adversaries understand the app's behavior and potentially exploit it (CWE-497) or may include sensitive information (CWE-540).
  topics:
  - non-production URLs
  - code flows
  - verbose logging (e.g., using logging utilities)
  - enabled testing utilities (e.g., StrictMode)
status: placeholder
