## 概要

This weakness occurs when an app does not implement or integrate techniques to detect malware on the device or malicious apps and components that could target it.

Mobile malware commonly attacks other apps indirectly: abusing accessibility services to read screens and drive the UI, drawing overlays to phish credentials, or exploiting a compromised runtime environment. For high-assurance apps, detecting a potentially hostile environment, e.g. known malicious packages, apps holding accessibility or overlay capabilities, or platform threat signals such as Google Play Protect status, allows the app to warn the user, restrict functionality, or trigger other protective responses. This complements environment-integrity checks such as @MASWE-0051 and platform services such as the Play Integrity API.

## 流入の形態

- **No Hostile-Environment Checks**: Not checking for known malicious packages or platform threat signals before enabling sensitive functionality.
- **Abuse-Prone Capabilities Ignored**: Not considering apps holding accessibility or overlay capabilities in the app's risk decisions for sensitive flows (see @MASWE-0039, @MASWE-0040).
- **No Response Strategy**: Detecting a hostile environment but not warning the user or restricting sensitive functionality.
- **Insufficient Response Strategy**: Only responding on the current device, rather than on the account level. Malware will often intercept credentials and use them to onboard a legitimate app onto an attacker-controlled device. As part of the response strategy, risky behaviour (such as onboarding the app on a new device) must be blocked in case of a suspected compromise.

## 影響

- **Compromise of Sensitive Data**: Malware can capture credentials, one-time codes, and displayed content while the app takes no protective action, resulting in exposure of user data the app could have defended.
- **Financial Loss**: Malware can automate or manipulate transactions against the unprotected app, resulting in direct financial harm to users and fraud losses for the app owner.

## 緩和策

- **Integrate Platform Threat Signals**: Use available platform services (e.g. Play Protect status, Play Integrity verdicts) to learn about known malware and a compromised environment.
- **Assess Risky Capabilities**: Factor the presence of accessibility- or overlay-capable apps into risk decisions for sensitive flows, combined with the UI-level defenses of @MASWE-0039 and @MASWE-0040.
- **Respond Proportionately**: Warn the user, require additional verification, restrict functionality, or block sensitive operations when a hostile environment is detected.
- **Lock Down Account**: Apply restrictions to the account, not just the local client. This will prevent attackers from performing actions on a non-hostile environment after the initial compromise.
- **Assess Effectiveness**: Validate the detection against current malware behaviors and update it as the threat landscape evolves.
