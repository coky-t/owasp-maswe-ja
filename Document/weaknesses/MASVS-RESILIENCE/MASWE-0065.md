## 概要

This weakness occurs when an app does not detect the presence of dynamic instrumentation and hooking frameworks at runtime.

Tools such as Frida, Xposed/LSPosed, and ElleKit/Cydia Substrate let attackers observe and modify the app while it runs, replacing method implementations and defeating client-side security controls. These frameworks can leave detectable artifacts, such as loaded libraries, named pipes, listening ports, installed hooks, or framework-specific classes, but attackers can often rename, relocate, hide, or patch these indicators to bypass shallow detection. Without layered detection and a response, instrumentation can proceed unnoticed.

Unlike runtime code integrity verification (see @MASWE-0058), this weakness focuses on detecting the presence of instrumentation tools and frameworks through tool-specific indicators. On the other hand, runtime code integrity verification checks whether loaded code, executable memory, or security-critical functions were modified, even when no known tool artifact is present.

## 流入の形態

- **No Instrumentation Checks**: Shipping without any detection of well-known instrumentation and hooking frameworks.
- **Artifact Checks Missing or Shallow**: Not checking for hooking artifacts such as suspicious loaded libraries, named pipes, listening ports, or known trampoline instruction sequences in function prologues, or checking only from easily hooked Java/Swift code.
- **No Response Strategy**: Detecting instrumentation but continuing to expose sensitive functionality.

## 影響

- **Bypass of Protection Mechanisms**: Attackers can hook and replace the app's security checks at runtime, resulting in the circumvention of its client-side defenses, including root, debugger, and integrity checks.
- **Compromise of Sensitive Data**: Attackers can intercept function arguments and memory contents during instrumentation, resulting in exposure of credentials, keys, and user data.

## 緩和策

- **Detect Instrumentation Artifacts**: Check for known frameworks and their artifacts (loaded libraries, named pipes, listening ports, hooked functions), implementing the checks in native code where they are harder to bypass.
- **Check Continuously and Diversify**: Run varied checks at multiple points in the app lifecycle so a single hook cannot disable them all.
- **Respond to Detection**: Terminate, restrict sensitive functionality, or signal the backend when instrumentation is detected.
- **Assess Effectiveness**: Regularly test the detection against current instrumentation tools and their evasion modules, and update it as they evolve.
