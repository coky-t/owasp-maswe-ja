## 概要

Apps that do not properly validate TLS certificates during secure communication are susceptible to [Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM)](../../Document/0x04f-Testing-Network-Communication.md#intercepting-network-traffic-through-mitm) attacks and other security threats. This weakness occurs when an app accepts invalid, expired, self-signed, or untrusted certificates without appropriate verification, compromising the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit.

## 影響

- **Data Interception**: Attackers can capture and read sensitive information transmitted over the network.
- **Data Manipulation**: Attackers might alter data in transit, causing corruption or injecting malicious content.
- **Data Exposure**: Sensitive information can be compromised.
- **Unauthorized Access**: Attackers may gain unauthorized access to user accounts or systems by intercepting authentication tokens or credentials.
- **Impersonation of Services**: Users may be deceived into interacting with malicious servers impersonating legitimate services.
- **Data Integrity Loss**: Altered or corrupted data may be accepted by the application, leading to unreliable or malicious outcomes.

## 流入の形態

- **Disabling Certificate Validation**: Developers disable or bypass certificate validation checks to simplify development or troubleshoot connectivity issues.
- **Accepting Self-Signed Certificates**: Applications accept self-signed or untrusted certificates without proper validation against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
- **Ignoring Hostname Verification**: Failing to verify that the certificate's hostname matches the server's hostname allows attackers to present valid certificates for other domains.
- **Using Insecure Custom Trust Managers**: Implementing custom certificate validation logic that is incomplete, incorrect, or insecure.
- **Incorrect Error Handling**: Proceeding with connections even when certificate validation errors occur, without alerting the user or terminating the connection.
- **Trusting All Certificates**: Configuring the application to trust all certificates by default, without any validation.

## 緩和策

- **Enforce Strict Certificate Validation**: Always validate TLS certificates against a trusted set of Certificate Authorities (CAs) provided by the operating system or a trusted third party.
- **Avoid Accepting Self-Signed Certificates**: Do not accept self-signed or untrusted certificates in production environments unless there is a secure mechanism to trust them explicitly.
- **Enable Hostname Verification**: Ensure that the application's network layer verifies the server's hostname against the certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or Common Name (CN).
- **Use Standard Trust Managers**: Utilize well-established libraries and platform-provided APIs for certificate validation instead of custom implementations.
- **Handle Validation Errors Properly**: Terminate the connection and alert the user whenever certificate validation fails due to issues like expiration, revocation, or mismatch.
