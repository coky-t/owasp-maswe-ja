## 概要

This weakness occurs when an app enables sensitive functionality without verifying that the device has a secure lock screen (passcode, PIN, pattern, or biometric) configured. Without a secure lock screen, cryptographic material cannot be protected with the highest level of security, and sensitive data may be exposed to anyone with physical access to the device.

Many of the platform's data-protection mechanisms assume a device credential exists: on iOS, file encryption classes tied to the passcode only protect data if a passcode is set, and on Android, keystore protections such as unlocked-device requirements are meaningless on a device with no lock.

## 流入の形態

- **No Secure-Lock Check**: Enabling sensitive features without verifying the device lock state, e.g., [`KeyguardManager.isDeviceSecure()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/KeyguardManager#isDeviceSecure()) on Android or [`LAContext.canEvaluatePolicy(_:error:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/lacontext/canevaluatepolicy%28_%3Aerror%3A%29) on iOS.
- **Data Protection Not Tied to the Passcode**: Storing sensitive items on iOS without passcode-dependent protection classes (e.g. [`kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecattraccessiblewhenpasscodesetthisdeviceonly)), so the data remains available even when no passcode is set.
- **Stale Device-Lock Assumption**: Checking the device-lock configuration only during onboarding or feature enrollment and continuing to enable the functionality after the device credential has been removed or the required authentication policy is no longer available.

## 影響

- **Compromise of Sensitive Data**: Attackers can open the app and read its data on a device with no lock, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of user data whose protection assumed a device credential.
- **Authentication or Authorization Bypass**: Attackers can act within the app's active sessions on an unprotected device, resulting in unauthorized use of the victim's accounts.

## 緩和策

- **Verify the Device Lock State**: Use platform APIs (e.g. `isDeviceSecure()` on Android, `canEvaluatePolicy` on iOS) to determine whether the current user has configured a PIN, pattern, or password.
- **Re-check Before Enabling Protected Functionality**: Evaluate the current device-lock configuration before enabling or accessing any high-risk functionality.
- **Bind Sensitive Key Use to Platform Authentication**: Where a sensitive operation depends on local cryptographic material, enforce authentication at the key-access layer rather than relying only on application UI state. For example, use the [Android Keystore](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/keystore) or the [iOS Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/accessing-keychain-items-with-face-id-or-touch-id) to force a biometric or passcode prompt before performing cryptographic operations.
