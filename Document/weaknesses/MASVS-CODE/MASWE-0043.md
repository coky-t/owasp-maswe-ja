## 概要

This weakness occurs when an app has no mechanism to force users to update to a more secure version after a critical vulnerability has been remediated.

When a critical vulnerability is found in a production app, the developer needs a way to migrate existing users to the latest version as quickly as possible. Platforms provide building blocks for this, such as Android In-App Updates (`AppUpdateManager`) and store version checks on iOS, but robust enforcement requires the backend to signal and enforce the minimum acceptable version.

## 流入の形態

- **No Enforced-Update Mechanism**: Shipping the app without any in-app or enforced update flow, so vulnerable versions keep working indefinitely.

## 影響

- **Compromise of Sensitive Data**: Attackers can exploit already-fixed vulnerabilities against users stuck on old versions, resulting in exposure of user data long after a patch was published.
- **Compromise of System Integrity and Business Operations**: The app owner cannot retire vulnerable versions from the installed base, resulting in a prolonged attack window.

## 緩和策

- **Implement an Enforced Update Flow**: Use platform mechanisms such as Android In-App Updates or a version check against the app store on iOS to require updating when a critical fix ships.
- **Enforce the Minimum Version Server-Side**: Have the backend declare the minimum supported app version and reject requests from older clients.
- **Distinguish Flexible and Immediate Updates**: Reserve blocking (immediate) updates for security-critical releases and use flexible updates otherwise, so users accept the mechanism when it matters.
