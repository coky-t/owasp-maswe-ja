## 概要

This weakness occurs when an app exposes sensitive data to accessibility APIs beyond what is necessary, making it harvestable by malicious or overly privileged accessibility services.

Accessibility services (e.g. Android's `AccessibilityService`) can observe screen content, read the text of on-screen nodes, and receive UI events across apps. This power is essential for assistive technology, but it also makes accessibility a common exfiltration and automation vector for malware: a malicious service that the user was tricked into enabling can harvest passwords, one-time codes, messages, and other personal data, and even drive the UI. Apps handling sensitive data should minimize what is exposed through accessibility metadata without degrading accessibility for legitimate users.

## 流入の形態

- **Secrets in Accessibility Metadata**: Exposing sensitive values through accessibility node text, labels, or hints beyond what assistive technology needs.
- **Sensitive Fields Not Using Secure Input**: Presenting secret input in fields that are not marked as password/secure entry, so their content is readable through accessibility APIs.
- **High-Risk Flows Fully Automatable**: Designing sensitive flows (e.g. payments) so that they can be completed entirely through programmatic UI interaction without any additional verification.
- **System Keyboards Exposing Sensitive Input**: Relying on standard system keyboards for passcode or PIN entry, which allows keyboard events and typed credentials to be captured by accessibility services.

## 影響

- **Compromise of Sensitive Data**: Attackers can read messages, personal data, and financial details from on-screen content, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of user data.
- **Authentication or Authorization Bypass**: Attackers can harvest credentials and one-time codes as they are displayed or entered, resulting in account takeover.
- **Financial Loss**: Attackers can combine harvested data with accessibility-driven UI automation to initiate fraudulent transactions, resulting in direct financial harm to the user.

## 緩和策

- **Keep Secrets Out of Accessibility Metadata**: Do not place sensitive values in accessibility labels, hints, or node text beyond what assistive technology requires.
- **Use Secure Input Fields**: Mark secret fields as password/secure entry so platforms mask their content from accessibility reading.
- **Add Friction to High-Risk Flows**: Require verification that UI automation cannot satisfy (e.g. biometric-bound confirmation, see @MASWE-0020) for the most sensitive actions.
- **Preserve Legitimate Accessibility**: Minimize only the sensitive values exposed; never degrade the app's overall accessibility for assistive-technology users.
- **Use Custom Passcode Inputs**: Replace standard system keyboards with an in-app custom keypad for sensitive entry fields, preventing accessibility services from capturing or announcing typed credentials.
